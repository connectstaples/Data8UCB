    "`Percentile` function:\n",
    "- The percentile function takes two arguments: a rank between 0 and 100, and a array. It returns the corresponding percentile of the array.\n",

    "Notes:\n",
    "- you can construct a confidence interval test at any level, or answer a question that is aiming to find the unknown parameter (with estimation by bootstrapping confidence interval)\n",
    "- When conducting bootstrap method:\n",
    "    - start with large random sample\n",
    "    replicate resampling 10,000 times\n",
    "    - The bootstrap percentile method works well for estimating the population median or mean based on a large random sample. For example, it is not expected to do well in the following situations.\n",
    "        - When it wont work: \n",
    "            - The goal is to estimate the minimum or maximum value in the population, or a very low or very high percentile, or parameters that are greatly influenced by rare elements of the population.\n",
    "            - The probability distribution of the statistic is not roughly bell shaped.\n",
    "            - The original sample is very small, say less than 10 or 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence Interval\n",
    "- A confidence interval has a single purpose – to estimate an unknown parameter based on data in a random sample.\n",
    "    - use confidence interval to test hypotheses \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# in this scenario, the hypothesis statement was that the population parameter equals a specific value (that means drop  =  0) && the alt hypothesis is the ≠ 0 \n",
    "def one_bootstrap_mean():\n",
    "    return np.average(table.sample().column('drop'))\n",
    "\n",
