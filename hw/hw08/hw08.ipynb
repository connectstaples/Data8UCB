    "\n",
    "The rules for the CLI are, if a sample is large and in some cases, drawn at random with replacement; the probability distribution of the sample average is roughly Normal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sample is large because we are working with a bootstrap samples with sample proportions from the population. Even if the distribution is not normal, we are able to create a roughly normal distribution because the sample size is large enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "This explains the Normal distribution above, because it is connected to random sample averages. We must care about sample averages because they estimate population averages and create confidence intervals based on population averages. Which is what we are interested in to mirror the true population proportion. \n"
