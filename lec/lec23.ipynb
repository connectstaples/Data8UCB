    "- Parameter: a number associated with the population\n",
    "- Statistic (can estimate a parameter): A number calculated from the sample\n",
    "- Population and Sample\n",
    "    - The key idea is that you use the data from your sample to make educated guesses (conclusions) about the population. For those conclusions to be accurate, your sample should represent the population well — e.g. it should include a diverse mix of people, not just students from one dorm or professors from one department.\n",
    "- Mean: _the average of a set of values, calculated by adding all the values together and dividing by the total number of values_ \n",
    "- Range: _the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset_\n",
    "- Bootstrap: _Bootstrapping is a resampling method in data science that estimates the variability of a statistic by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the original dataset_ \n",
    "- Confidence Interval \n",
    "    - take off extremes, within bounds of the array `left` and `right`. Yellow is the confidence interval, and the green dot will be in there \n",
    "    - I dont have a population -> you use the sample from the dataset, and conduct tests like the dataset results is the population, by taking bootstrap samples of the main sample. \n",

    "1. Take a random sample from the population\n",
    "2. obtain a statistic from this sample\n",
    "3. Use this statistic as an estimate of the parameter\n",
    "    - However… estimates change everytime you sample, thus you use a bound range that can withhold the unknown population parameter \n",
    "\n",
    "For a range, we have to know what can happen\n",
    "1. So, we need multiple samples to see multiple values. So you must sample at random from the original sample, if it represents the population (large and random og sample)\n",

    "Steps:\n",
    "    1. Draw with replacement, at random, and as many values as are in the original sample\n",

    "Notes:\n",
    "- We get a new sample from our old data that we have, by bootstrapping\n",
    "    - this method is applied for data scientists that have limited funding (which is usually all studies)\n",
    "- A sample from the population is usually only done once (historic data for example, or to save time). You must simulate with bootstrapping to work with that data \n",
    "- **Jeremy is allergic to repeating code**\n",
    "- Obtain a statistic many times from bootstrap samples because the statistic can vary between samples **(empirical distribution of observed dataset)** \n",
    "    - This works based on degree of probability for dataset which needs to be assessed \n",
    "- We are currently in an inference module:\n",
